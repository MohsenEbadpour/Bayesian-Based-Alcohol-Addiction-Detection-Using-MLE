# Bayesian-Based Alcohol Addiction Detection Using MLE

This repository contains code for a problem related to Bayesian based Alcohol Addiction Detection in pattern recognition. The problem involves estimate distribution parameters (normal distribution) using Maximum Likelihood Estimation(MLE) and use it for classification goal.

## Course Information

This problem is related to a *Statistical Pattern Recognition* course taught by Professor Mohammad Rahmati (<rahmati@aut.ac.ir>) in the Computer Engineering department at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran, Iran. The course was offered in the Fall of 2021.

## Problem Description

The problem involves analyzing a test set of data assuming normal distribution for two classes. The goal is to estimate distribution parameters using maximum likelihood estimation for randomly picked 10, 50, and 100 samples, design a classifier, find errors using the test set, and repeat the process using Bayesian estimation method. In the case of 100 samples, the goal is to use trial and error to find two parameters that yield the highest classification accuracy and plot the class distribution and Bayes decision boundary for these parameters
